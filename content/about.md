# About me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/picture.png" alt="avatar">}}

Iâ€™m a 4th year PhD student at Humboldt University of Berlin and MDC Berlin.
My supervisors are Ulf Leser and Jana Wolf.
I am interested in developing Machine Learning methods for extracting structured information from text.
I am doing this mostly in the biomedical domain to build tools that may help to make sense of the enormous amount of research publications.
I apply Machine Learning also to other problems in Biology and I am interested in approaches for computational reasoning.

Before my starting my PhD in 2018, I completed my MSc and BSc in Computer Science at Humboldt University and Free University in Berlin. I also hold a BA in Philosophy from Bamberg University.

# Personal News

* **Apr 2022** We, the [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co) biomedical working group, are hosting a hackathon with the goal to bring all biomedical NLP datasets into a unified format. [Come join us!](https://hfbigbio.github.io)

* **Nov 2021** Our team achieved the first rank out of 30 in the [BCVII DrugProt Shared Task](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-1/) on extracting protein-chemical relations from scientific articles. Thanks to all team members, this was a great collaboration!

* **Mar 2021** Our contribution to the [BioNLP 2021 Shared Task on Consumer Health Question Summarization](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021) achieved the second rank out of 23 submissions. Working with generative models was a really fun experience, I'm looking forward to do this again.
