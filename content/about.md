# About me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/picture.png" alt="avatar">}}

I am a researcher at [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/) where I work with Barbara Plank on human-centric NLP. Currently, I am trying to figure out how human-in-the-loop approaches can be used to improve NLP models. I am also still interested in the application of NLP to the biomedical domain.

Before that I was a PhD student at Humboldt University of Berlin and MDC Berlin.
Where I worked on biomedical NLP with Ulf Leser and Jana Wolf.

Before starting my PhD in 2018, I completed my MSc and BSc in Computer Science at Humboldt University and Free University in Berlin. I also hold a BA in Philosophy from Bamberg University.

# Personal News

* **Nov 2022** I joined [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/) as a researcher. I am looking forward to working with the team and to learn a lot about human-centric NLP.

* **Apr 2022** We, the [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co) biomedical working group, are hosting a hackathon with the goal to bring all biomedical NLP datasets into a unified format. [Come join us!](https://hfbigbio.github.io)

* **Nov 2021** Our team achieved the first rank out of 30 in the [BCVII DrugProt Shared Task](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-1/) on extracting protein-chemical relations from scientific articles. Thanks to all team members, this was a great collaboration!

* **Mar 2021** Our contribution to the [BioNLP 2021 Shared Task on Consumer Health Question Summarization](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021) achieved the second rank out of 23 submissions. Working with generative models was a really fun experience, I'm looking forward to do this again.
